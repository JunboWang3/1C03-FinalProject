# Engineering Design and Graphics
Throughout the project, our team was tasked with designing a low-cost grasping device for the entire right-hand prosthesis, focusing specifically on the index finger and thumb. We first designed the required physical gears and components, then used Autodesk Inventor for 3D modeling and 3D printing to create the prototype. The designed transmission mechanism ensures the coordinated and counter-movement of the index finger and thumb, simulating real hand movements. The design serves as a proof of concept to demonstrate the feasibility of more advanced prosthetics.
